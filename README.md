# Alan Author Strikes Again: More on Confirming Conjunctions of Disconfirmed Hypotheses

The Alan Author Effect is a surprising phenomenon in Bayesian Confirmation Theory. It occurs when a piece of evidence E confirms the conjunction of two hypotheses H1âˆ§H2 but at the same time disconfirms each hypothesis H1 and H2 individually, more formally:

1. $P(H_1\land H_2|E)>P(H_1\land H_2)$
1. $P(H_1|E)<P(H_1)$ and $P(H_2|E)<P(H_2)$

Interestingly, there is a new and seemingly stronger version of this effect where additionally, E confirms that *both* hypotheses are *false*:

3. $P(\neg H_1\land \neg H_2|E)>P(\neg H_1\land \neg H_2)$

And even more interestingly, this seemingly stronger effect and the original effect are *coextensional*. This means that the Strong Alan Author Effect occurs if and only if the Original Alan Author Effect occurs.

This repo examines how likely the two versions of the Alan Author Effect are to occur with the help of Monte Carlo simulation methods. It also compares them to instances of Simpson's Paradox.

## Results

Two types of prevalence values are calculated:

1. *Conjunctive Prevalence*:
    - For the Original Alan Author Effect: proportion of probability functions satisfying conditions 1 and 2.
    - For the Strong Alan Author Effect: proportion of probability functions satisfying conditions 1, 2 and 3.

1. *Conditional Prevalence*:
    - For the Original Alan Author Effect: proportion of probability functions satisfying conditions 1 *among* the probability functions satisfying condition 2.
    - For the Strong Alan Author Effect: proportion of probability functions satisfying conditions 1 *among* the probability functions satisfying conditions 2 and 3.

Since the Original Alan Author Effect and the Strong Alan Author Effect are coextensional, their conjunctive prevalence must be identical. For comparison, the prevalence of instances of Simpson's Paradox are also provided. The results are shown in the table below:

      <td id="T_74a50_row1_col1" class="data row1 col1" >0.025101</td>
      <td id="T_74a50_row1_col2" class="data row1 col2" >0.111581</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td id="T_74a50_row2_col0" class="data row2 col0" >Simpson's Paradox</td>
      <td id="T_74a50_row2_col1" class="data row2 col1" >0.008324</td>
      <td id="T_74a50_row2_col2" class="data row2 col2" >0.033288</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

The investigated instances of Simpson's Paradox are cases where the following conditions are jointly satisfied:

4. $P(H\land E|X)>P(H|X)P(E|X)$
4. $P(H\land E|\neg X)>P(H|\neg X)P(E|\neg X)$
4. $P(H\land E)\ngtr P(H)P(E)$

The above results show that even though the Alan Author Effect not very prevalent, it is more likely to occur than instances of Simpson's Paradox.
