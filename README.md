# Alan Author Strikes Again: More on Confirming Conjunctions of Disconfirmed Hypotheses

The Alan Author Effect is a surprising phenomenon in Bayesian Confirmation Theory. It occurs when a piece of evidence confirms the conjunction of two hypotheses but at the same time disconfirms each hypothesis individually, more formally:

1. $P(H_1\land H_2|E)>P(H_1\land H_2)$
1. $P(H_1|E)<P(H_1)$ and $P(H_2|E)<P(H_2)$

Surprisingly, there is a new and prima facie stronger
version of this effect where additionally, the evidence confirms the conjunction of the negated hypotheses:

3. $P(\neg H_1\land \neg H_2|E)>P(\neg H_1\land \neg H_2)$

And perhaps even more surprisingly, this seemingly stronger effect and the original effect are actually *coextensional*.

This repo examines how likely the two effects are to occur with the help of Monte Carlo simulation methods.
